          <h1>Rules for booking equipment</h1>
          <h2>
          <ul>
            <li>You may only reserve two timeslots at the same time in the Cisco lab rooms.</li>
            <li>Don't book these two slots across the lunch-break (Meaning from 10:00 - 15:00), rather stick to either morning/afternoon if you need double timeslots.</li>
            <li>Ensure you return your station to its original condition before your timeslot ends so the next student kan begin on time.</li>
            <li>When you reserve a slot, prioritize working together with a classmate to ensure everyone has a fair chance to access the lab.</li>
            <li>Food and drink may <b>not</b> be consumed at the desks and must be left at the small tables located at the entrance of all the lab rooms.</li>
            <li>University scheduled activities will always take priority over student reservations, see <a href="https://schema.hv.se">schema.hv.se</a> or the bottom of the booking page for the lab room to check upcoming scheduled activities.</li>
          </ul> 
              <b>Repeated violations of these rules can result in restrictions on your ability to access this bookable resource.</b><br>
